/**
 * This file handles the API route for fetching recommended questions for a user.
 *
 * It first checks if the User already has cached recommended questions.
 * If cached data is found, it returns that data.
 * If not, it fetches the user's interview history and companies,
 * retrieves a set of random questions from the database,
 * and then generates recommendations based on the user's interviews (topics and difficulty) and companies.
 * Finally, it caches the recommended questions for future requests and returns the recommended questions.
 *
 * Recommended questions are selected based on the user's interview history, and the companies they are interested in.
 * It weights questions heavier if the user has previously interviewed and struggled on similar topics.
 * It also considers the difficulty of the questions that the user has previously attempted,
 * and uses how well they performed to adjust the recommendations.
 *
 * For example, if a user has previously struggled with medium difficulty questions,
 * the system will recommend more more medium and easy questions.
 *
 * If the user struggles on easy questions, the system will recommend more easy questions.
 * If the user seems to be unable to answer any questions and especially struggles with easy questions,
 * the algorithm will recommend 5 "core" questions that are fundamental to interviewing.
 *
 * If the user struggles on hard questions, the system will recommend more hard questions and medium questions.
 *
 * The algorithm will also not recommend questions that the user has attempted in the last 30 days.
 *
 * The algorithm also will weight questions heavier if the question is from a company that the user has targeted.
 * If the user has answered many questions from a specific company, the algorithm will recommend less questions from that company.
