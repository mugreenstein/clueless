## Getting Started

### Quick Start

For a quick start, I've included throwaway keys and databases in `.env.example`. You can simply rename this file to `.env` and uncomment out the part at the bottom, so that you can get started without setting up your own keys.

### Setting Up Your Own Environment

If you prefer to use your own keys and databases:

1. **API Keys**:

   - Get a Google GenAI API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/u/1/apikey/)
   - Obtain a Judge0 API key from [Judge0 on RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/judge0-official/api/judge0-ce/)

2. **Next-Auth Secret**:

   - Generate a secret using:
     ```bash
     openssl rand -base64 32
     ```

3. **Database Setup**:

   - Set up a basic Postgres database (a free one from [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) works well)
   - Set up a Redis server for caching (use [Redis Cloud](https://redis.com/redis-enterprise-cloud/overview/) or run locally)

4. **Environment Configuration**:

   - Add all values to your `.env` file (use `.env.example` as a template)

5. **Project Setup**:
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Run database migrations:
     ```bash
     npx prisma migrate dev
     ```
   - Start the development server:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
